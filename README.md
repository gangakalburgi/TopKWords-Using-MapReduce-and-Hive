# TopKWords-Using-MapReduce-and-Hive

This Repository contains 2 Java Map Reduce programs to find top 100 words and top 100 words of length greater than 6 
from a bigdata file(have tested with 32gb .txt file).

This was practice coding exercise to learn MapReduce and Hive frameworks. 


The Map Reduce programs are Wordcount1(for top 100 words) and WordCount2 (for top100 with length > 6). 

The performance of MapReduce program was evaluated by changing number of Mapper, Reducers and also by adding Combiners.
